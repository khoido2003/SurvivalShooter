# Unity MonoBehaviour Execution Order (Quick Reference)

Docs: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/execution-order.html

This file explains the order Unity calls built-in MonoBehaviour methods.  
Use this as a guide to avoid confusion when working with object pooling, activation, and initialization.

---

## ðŸŸ£ Initialization
1. **`Awake()`**
   - Called immediately when the object is created (scene load or `Instantiate`).
   - Runs **once per lifetime**, even if disabled.
   - Use for: setting up references, creating data, internal state.

2. **`OnEnable()`**
   - Called every time the object is enabled (`gameObject.SetActive(true)` or `component.enabled = true`).
   - Runs after `Awake`.
   - Use for: event subscriptions, resetting values.

3. **`Start()`**
   - Called only **once**, the first frame the object is active.
   - Runs after all `Awake` + `OnEnable` calls have finished.
   - Use for: initialization that depends on other objects being ready.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Game Loop
- **`FixedUpdate()`**
  - Runs at a fixed interval (good for physics).
  - May run multiple times per frame or be skipped depending on framerate.

- **`Update()`**
  - Runs once per frame.
  - Use for: gameplay logic, input handling.

- **`LateUpdate()`**
  - Runs after all `Update()` calls.
  - Use for: camera follow, order-dependent updates.

---

## ðŸŸ  Physics Events
- **`OnTriggerEnter/Stay/Exit(Collider other)`**
- **`OnCollisionEnter/Stay/Exit(Collision collision)`**
  - Called when physics detects trigger/collision events.

---

## ðŸ”´ Rendering Events
- **`OnPreCull()`** â€“ before the camera culls objects.  
- **`OnWillRenderObject()`** â€“ before rendering this object.  
- **`OnRenderObject()`**, **`OnPostRender()`**, **`OnRenderImage()`** â€“ for custom rendering effects.  
- **`OnBecameVisible()` / `OnBecameInvisible()`** â€“ when renderer enters/exits camera view.

---

## âš« Disable & Destroy
- **`OnDisable()`**
  - Called when object is disabled.
  - Use for: unsubscribing from events, stopping coroutines.

- **`OnDestroy()`**
  - Called when object is destroyed or scene unloads.
  - Use for: cleanup, releasing resources.

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Application Events
- **`OnApplicationPause(bool pause)`** â€“ app pauses (mobile).  
- **`OnApplicationFocus(bool focus)`** â€“ app focus gained/lost.  
- **`OnApplicationQuit()`** â€“ app is quitting.
